# <p style="color:#0000FF;">🔭 About Pionia</p>


Pionia is a REST-ful framework that gives API development a rather new and simpler approach. It is based on the Moonlight Architecture(formaerly in-house). 


Pionia believes developers should spend more time focusing on the business logic not framework logic. Traditional concepts like routes, controllers, models and more are handled a little-bit differently or even trimmed off. 


In Pionia you will find the following unique features:- 

1. Single API endpoint per API-version.
2. Simpler and rather different way to version APIs.
3. No models, but an intuitive and pragmatic query builder - Piql(formerly Porm).
4. Switches for mapping incoming traffic to the right service(You may need only one!).
5. Services. Unlike services in the traditional, this is where you will spend most if not all of your time like `AuthService`.
6. Actions. The lowest unit of your business logic like `loginAction` in `AuthService`
7. Only POST HTTP verb for every request. Don't worry about caching, we handle that too!

Pionia is built on battle-tested Symfony, Nette, Moonlog components and many more ensuring its quick stability.
